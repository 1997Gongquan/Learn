The Temple of Heaven was the venue for emperors of the Ming and Qi Dynasties to offer sacrifices to the heaven and pray for good harvest. It is round in the north and square in the south, implying "round heaven and square earth".  Covering an area of 273 hectares, it is divided by two enclosed walls into the Inner Altar and the Outer Altar. Principal buildings congregate within the Inner Altar. The Inner Altar is also partitioned by a wall into two groups of buildings. The north structure is the Altar of Praying for Bumper Crops with the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests as the principal building used to pray in spring for a bumper harvest in the year. The south structure is the Circular Mound Altar used to worship Heaven at the winter solstice where the principal construction is a large round marble terrace named the Circular Mound. A masterpiece of the Ming and Qing architectural art and a precious example of china's ancient architecture, The Temple of Heaven is the largest architectural group for worshipping Heaven in the world.  In 1998, it was recognized by the UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage.
The fundamental goals of science not only lie in the research into and understanding of natural phenomena, but also lie in taking this advantage to make our life more comfortable and convenient. Science and technology help us create more economical and convenient approaches to regain useful materials from nature, and use them in our daily life. We can use chemistry to synthesize new materials, whose properties can meet our needs and are better than natural ones. We need various types of materials to meet our needs in daily life. Some of them can be gained from nature, while others can be created by humans.
Green energy is crucial to building a sustainable society. Not only are there jobs in the field, but involvement in the industry provides plenty of opportunities for students in this field to be creative. According to the estimate of the National Energy Administration in July, the new energy sector is set to create 150 million jobs by 2020. The Clean Development Mechanism, a new set out in the Kyoto Protocol in 2007, aims at helping developing countries to fulfill their emission reduction goals and will enable some companies to find financing for new energy projects
At the Jiuquan Space Center,Shenzhou 5 is scheduled to blast into orbit atop a Changzhen(Long March)rocket.Nut unlike those 4 unmanned Shenzhou test spacecrafts which have already made orbital flights,Shenzhou 5 is expected to carry a crew of up to 3 young pilots,which will make China the 3rd nation to send people into space.Although representatives of 3 dozen countries have gone into orbit since the dawn of the space age,they have all traveled aboard either American or Russian spacecraft.Chinas space agency,however,built several key systems on its own,and in some ways the Shenzhou is technologically superior to the Soyuz.
raditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) boasts of a complete theoretical system with its uniqueness in the overall outlook of the unity of Heaven and Man, and in treatment based on syndrome differentiation. Traditionally Chinese Medicine holds that man is a part of nature which is composed of the two groups of Yin and Yang. The Qi Yin and Yang are contradictory but interdependent, and always in motion and change. In the normal physiological condition, Yin and Yang are in dynamic equilibrium. Once the equilibrium is damaged, the condition will be shifted into the pathological one. And when treating diseases or correcting the imbalance of Yin and Yang, one should observe them with a changing perspective rather than look at them statically and isolatedly. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the regularity of human life as well as the occurrence of diseases is closely related to the changes of nature.
White pollution mainly refers to the two negative effects on the environment: "visual pollution"and "potential hazards"due to the ineffective management and disposal of plastic rubbish. White pollution is also called plastic pollution. The disposable foam plastic dishes are discarded on the sides of the railways, or in the rivers and lakes. If we continue using them, what would happen? One day they might bury us in an ocean of white rubbish. Then the earth, our common homeland, would be a dustbin. To prevent this nightmare from coming true, governments need to work closely with each other and back up their verbal commitment by actions. We, as individuals, should start from ourselves to help protect the green environment.
English writing should meet the writing standards, the English letters should be written clearly, neatly, beautifully, the size of the letters and the distance between the letters should be symmetrical. Writing should be done so that the font beautiful beautiful, symmetrical harmony throughout.

Write English letters to master the correct stroke sequence. For example, the lowercase letter I, you should write down the part of the face first and then dot it. Some students according to the habit of writing Chinese characters from top to bottom, write fast, will be the point and the following pen together, it is very awkward. T should be two strokes. Many people combine the two strokes, which look like an l or an e rather than a t. In addition, r for v, q for g, k for h and so on, are common problems in middle school students' writing.

Many people have rules for writing on practice paper with four lines and three squares. They can write according to the scale, height and size of the letters, but on white paper or horizontal paper, it seems very naive and clumsy. Letters may jump up and down, or they may all be written to the same height, and there is no difference between a letter in the top two boxes and a letter in the bottom two boxes. These phenomena must be prevented.

In addition, when writing, we should pay attention to keep a certain distance between words, not close together. The concatenation of letters should also be in accordance with custom, not random.

In a limited number of words in the composition, we should also pay attention to try not to separate a word. In case you want to move, you have to move in syllables. Revolution, for example, you can move in syllables by re-, revo-, revolu-. In making the transition, we should also pay special attention to the following points:

Monosyllables cannot shift, even for monosyllables with more letters, such as through, etc.

2. Abbreviations such as Mr., Dr., etc., should not be separated from the name after them. U.K.(the UnitedKingdom), U.S.A(United States of America), etc.

3. Time, measurement and monetary units should be considered as one unit; No separate transitions.

For example: 11:00 P.M. should be written in one line, not separate 11:00 P.M. from PM. When you write 38, you cannot move 38 and  separately The date indicated by year, month, day. If the migration must be separated, only the month, day and year can be separated. For example, January 6, 1980 cannot be moved separately between January and 6, but January 6, and 1980 can be divided into two rows.

5. For words with double consonants, separate the consonants as you move. If better can be changed into bet-ter, the necessary necessary can be changed into neces-sary.

But if a double consonant is part of the root of the word and a suffix is added, you cannot separate the two consonants. If it becomes drilling by adding -ing, it cannot be separated as dri-ling, but as drilling.

Epistolary writing is a common form of functional writing in practical writing. The preparation for epistolary writing is a macro one, which means to master its format and basic framework. The second is micro, specific to how the language is used.

Letter format

First, the structure of letter writing investigation

30. The writer will place the date (year, month, day) on the upper right corner of the body of the letter, as Jan. 30th, 2010.

Remind: take an examination of grind letter writing does not ask examinee to must write time, if do not grasp oneself time to write the form is correct, suggest examinee does not write, lest make a mistake to deduct a mark instead.

Address is the address of the addressee to the addressee. Address can be written according to the gender, position, marital status, name and other personal information of the addressee, such as Mr. Williams,Mrs. Bush, Professor Li, Dr. Smith, Dear Mum and Dad

If the writer does not know the recipient's exact name, job title, etc., write: Dear Sir Or Madam, To whom it may concern.

The body, which is the main part of the letter, begins one or two lines below the salutation. When the examinee writes the text, must carry on the stratification. The body of a letter usually consists of three levels: the introduction, the opening paragraph and the end.

introduction. The introduction indicates the writer's purpose and background of writing the letter. It is usually limited to a paragraph or two sentences.

Warning: examinee here prone to make a mistake: copy the topic's expression, or even the original sentence, this is a serious mistake, in the marking process will be deducted at least 2 points, hope the vast number of examinee should pay attention to.

expand paragraph. Expand paragraph should be detailed and specific. It can be divided into several paragraphs, each focusing on a topic.

Remind: remind broad examinee, the key point in the question stem must contain completely, examinee if in omits a key point (general small composition has 3 key points) can deduct at least 3 points.

closing. The closing is usually shorter than the introduction. Use a sentence or two to express a wish or wish.

The conclusion, which is the author's modest title to the recipient, is written two or three lines below the text. Use Yours sincerely, sincerely Yours, Yours faithfully, Yours truly and other formal letters. Personal letters, use Yours, more Withlove, Yours affectionately, etc.

5. Signature, signature should be written under the conclusion.

Operation of body paragraph language

The letter is written and thought as instructed. The letter is a letter of complaint, a letter of application or a letter of request. Why am I writing this letter? Common sentence patterns include:

I am writing to complain about...

I am writing to thank you. The for... / express mygratitude for...

I am writing to ask for...

I am writing to apply for...

The second paragraph of the text, about 100 words, 8, 9 sentences.

The central task of this paragraph is to extend the outline of the topic. If there are three Outlines, expand each outline by three sentences. How to expand, mainly to play a little imagination, there are two ways of thinking, one is to split the meaning into a number of meaning, two is to say a thing more specific image. For example, the first instruction, which says books, can be divided into a variety of books, and that's called the semantic split. You can also describe exactly what these books look like. Similarly, the methods ofpayment in the second instruction and the time and way of delivery in the third instruction can be extended by these two methods.

[dynamic programming] backpack problem (I) 01 backpacks full backpacks multiple backpacks





01 backpack



There are N items and a backpack with a capacity of V. The price (volume) of item I is w[I] and the value is c[I]. Figure out which items to pack so that the total cost of these items does not exceed the backpack capacity and the total value is the largest.



This is the most basic knapsack problem, in general is: to choose or not, that is a question < /



This is equivalent to using f[I][j] to represent the maximum value that can be obtained from the first I backpacks loaded with v backpacks.



There are only two cases for an item



Case 1: if I is not put in, then the value obtained is f[i-1][v].



Case 2: put in the I, then the value is f[i-1][v-c[I]]+w[I]



Equation of state for: [I] [v] f = Max (f [v], [I - 1] f [I - 1] [v [I]] - w + c [I])

herbalism



Title Description

Chen Chen is a gifted child, his dream is to become the world's greatest doctor. He wanted to learn from the most respected doctor in the neighborhood. In order to judge his qualifications, the doctor gave him a difficult problem. The doctor took him to a cave full of herbs and said to him, "son, there are some different herbs in this cave. I will give you a period of time during which you can gather some herbs. If you are a clever boy, you should be able to maximize the total value of the herbs you collect."



If you are Chen Chen, can you finish the task?



Input Description

Input the first line with two integers T (1<=T<=1000) and M (1<=M<=100) separated by a space, T represents the total time available for collection, and M represents the number of herbs in the cave. Each of the following M rows contains two integers between 1 and 100 (including 1 and 100), representing the time it took to pick a particular herb and the value of the herb.



Output Description

The output consists of a line containing only an integer indicating the maximum total value of the herbs that can be collected over a specified period of time.

Printf (" % d \ n ", f [m]); // f(m) is the optimal solution

Return 0;

}

Copy the code

Complete backpack



There are N items and a V backpack, with an unlimited number of items available for each item. The cost of item I is w[I] and the value is c[I]. Figure out which items to pack so that the total cost of these items does not exceed the backpack capacity and the total value is the largest.



A complete backpack is very similar to a 01 backpack, except that there are an infinite number of complete backpack items. From the previous choice or not to choose to choose or not to choose, choose a few. Square root



Like 01 knapsack, we can write the equation of state: [I] [v] f = Max (f] [I - 1 - k * c [I] [v] [I] * w + k | 0 < = k * c [I] < = v)



There is also a simple optimization 



When the value of an item is less than the value of another item, but the price is higher than another item, we can ignore the item. If two items I and j satisfy c[I]<=c[j] and w[I]>=w[j], then item j will be removed without consideration. Why do we want to buy an expensive and bad things? del

Here is v++ order different from 01 backpack

F [v] = Max (f/v - w [I]] + [I], c f [v]);

Printf (" % d \ n ", f [m]); // f[m] is the optimal solution

Return 0;

Multiple backpacks



There are N items and a backpack of V capacity. Item I has a maximum of n[I] pieces available, each costing w[I] and having a value of c[I]. Figure out which items to pack so that the total cost of these items does not exceed the backpack capacity and the total value is the largest.



There is another restriction here, each item specifies the number of times it can be used.



In the same way, we can get the equation of state: [I] [v] f = Max (f [I - 1] [v [I]] - k * w + k * c [I] | 0 < = k < = n [I])

Good article to pay close attOne, the introduction

With the formation of the new employment mechanism of college graduates, the employment of computer major in independent colleges should look forward to the employment prospect, face the severe situation, change the working concept, improve the working mode, and improve the level and effect of the employment guidance of computer major in independent colleges

Second, self-analysis

I'm gong quan, a student majoring in computer science and technology. From a rural family, the future only rely on their own struggle. Knowing that my parents have always been open-minded, no matter what decisions their children make, they are always behind them with invisible support and encouragement. Speaking of hobbies, I am best at sports and writing. Optimistic me, like a person quietly sitting to think about life dribs and drabs, like to use words to express my inner world, with words to light up my life; Lively and cheerful, I like jogging, like playing basketball, badminton and other sports.

Looking forward to the university campus, I want to cut a figure, all the time to play their own strengths. Therefore, all kinds of community activities, organizations, always filled with my figure. More friends, more roads. I know, all this, is a recognition of their own, is to their ability to deal with people again and again to improve.

When it comes to my future, I am at a loss. Want to take an examination of military school when high school, can the university entrance exam plays is abnormal, holding the confidence that takes an examination of grind come to this university this major of a strange combination of circumstances. When I was a freshman, I was dissatisfied with my so-called college life. Regardless of my classmates' and teachers' encouragement, I resolutely went to enlist in the army. As a result, I failed due to various reasons. Because of my low interest in computer, my desire for postgraduate entrance examination is getting lower and lower.

Two years have passed, and when I think about what I have learned, the answer is zero. Although the academic mark of professional course of every exam is very high, but those who differ very far is practice. Most of what you learn in college is how to do things.

What I lack is a perfect combination of theory and practice, and a clearer and deeper understanding of my major. Thinking about it carefully, in the friction and collision of various languages, I prefer the operation of the database, as for the web page, the depth of the website, I do not know how to start

Job analysis

1. Shortage of IT talents

(1) the world IT talent shortage, demand rational adjustment

(2) the total number of IT talents in China is seriously insufficient

(3) there is a serious shortage of IC talents, network storage talents, e-commerce talents, information security talents and game technology talents

(4) in terms of software talent hierarchy, there are not enough high-level system analysts and project planners with industry background, and there is a shortage of blue-collar software workers

2. Strong market demand

(1) steady changes in industry demand

(2) the formation of enterprise demand pattern

(3) significant regional demand differences

3. Fierce competition for jobs

(1) a buyer's market has been formed

(2) the employment pattern is gradually clear

4. Lagging employment

(1) improve employment channels

2) we will strengthen employment guidance

(3) improve the quality of students

5. Disjointed personnel training

(1) undergraduate computer talent training focuses on characteristics

In the job market of college students, the supply and demand of computer talents are flourishing, and the buyer's market is gradually formed. The essence of "supply exceeds demand" and "difficult employment" of college students is not the surplus of talents, but the structural imbalance of supply and demand. The cultivation of computer professionals in colleges and universities should aim at the changes of IT talent market, adjust the mode and highlight the characteristics. In the face of the increasingly severe employment situation, college students should also change the employment concept, "first employment, then choose an occupation",

Career opportunity assessment

At present, with the increasing number of computer graduates in colleges and universities, the employment advantages of computer major are disappearing. In addition to the objective factors such as the increase of the number of people, the dislocation of college major setting, training mode and market demand change is an important factor. However, due to the high fees, lower scores and the society's incomplete recognition of the quality of independent college graduates, the computer major of independent college will encounter many problems in employment. Since 2002, the first employment rate of computer major in colleges and universities has been declining year after year, becoming a hot spot in the employment market of college students and receiving general attention from all aspects of the society. But it is worth pointing out that employment prospects are bright as long as expertise is strong.

Determination of career goals

Relying on my own professional knowledge, I entered the IT industry, starting from the most basic programmer, gradually developing into a network engineer, and finally starting my own company.

Plan and implement career goals

In my second year of college, I have passed cet-4 and passed cet-6. In the second half of the year, I will pass the national computer test band 2. Learn the necessary professional basic knowledge, through various channels, expand their other aspects of knowledge. Especially enterprise management knowledge, for their future development to lay a good foundation.

In the third year of college, I passed the national computer rank examination, mastered more professional knowledge, made deeper development in my major, understood the employment situation, and prepared for employment.

About the fourth grade, get all kinds of necessary certificates, successfully complete the study, find a job in line with their major.

Within ten years after graduation, I have been working hard, combining theory with practice, strengthening my comprehensive ability, actively performing, and striving for promotion opportunities. I am a programmer, a software developer, a software engineer... Business managers. Finally, start your own company.

Review, feedback and revision

The road to work may be very difficult, especially the road to start their own business, capital will be the biggest obstacle, because of all kinds of difficulties in the position, business time can be extended to 15 years, even 20 years, carefully observe the Chinese market, seriously consider their own development.



Viii. Alternative plan

Teacher: within four years of university, after completing the required studies, I will get a teaching certificate. If the job prospect of computer science is too bad, I will engage in the education career. Teaching is undoubtedly a good job for a girl.

Ix. Conclusion

No matter what the future employment situation is, the most important thing now is to lay a good foundation, equip yourself with excellent professional knowledge, firmly believe in your choice, and make efforts for it, I believe I will be successful.
